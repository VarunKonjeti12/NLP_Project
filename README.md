# NLP_Project
Many people check item/product reviews to decide whether to buy it or not, but some reviews may be too long to read. So in this project we are going to summarize the long reviews that is text summarization (including key word extraction) and implement aspect based sentiment analysis on it.
## MODELS USED
TEXT SUMMARIZATION - BartForConditionalGeneration <br />
KEY WORD EXTRACTION - Using Yake library <br />
ASPECT BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - Stanza <br />

Coming to the files that are there in the repository, we have uploaded separate code files for the above the tasks, and we also uploaded other files in which we and written some demo codes initially, on that basis we built our code for the application.
